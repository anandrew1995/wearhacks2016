## Hello Forest

This is a project that was created as a part of WearHacks Toronto 2016 Hackathon.

Feel free to see our demo [HERE](https://youtu.be/6rTLdffu-Wc)

## Design

This is our virtual reality game called Hello Forest. The inspiration for the idea came from Osmos’ VR campaign challenge, in which they wanted contestants to make a game world for brave kids fighting illness to experience. The virtual experience is made so that minimum movement is needed with additional gaming experience when requested.

## Functionality

The main goal of the game is to allow children to experience friendly interactions with animals while given the option to engage in a simple rewarding game based simulation. The realistic wilderness will contain free roaming animals, which the user can watch and interact with. By using the Myo Gesture Control armband, the player will be able to use a “come hither” gesture to coax animals (in this case a kitten) closer to him/her. Once the kitten is in range, it sits and waits for the player to initiate a classic game of rock paper scissors. If the player wins the game, the user wins the affection of the animal, which is quantified in a heart meter. If the player loses the game however, the kitten will run away and the player will have to try to coax it back again.
